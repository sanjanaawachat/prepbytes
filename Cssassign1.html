 <b><i>What is Css?</i>
 </b><br>
 
 <ol type="1">
  <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br>
   
  <li> CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper, or in other media.</li><br> 
 
   <li><span class ="sja">Css is not neccesary</span> <span class="sgl">CSS saves a lot of work.</span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li><br>
 
   <li><u><i> External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</i></u></li><br>
</ol>

<b><i>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</i> 
 
<ul>
    <li>Inline - by using usingthe style attribujte inside HTML elements1</li>
    <li>Internal- by using a style elementnin the head section </li>
    <li>External- by using a link element to link to an external css file.</li>
    <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However, <span class="kgl">in this tutorial We will use inline and internal styles,</span>because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
</ul>

<p>When comparing CSS class vs ID , the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elkements.ID, on the other hand ,applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use  a special URL to link directly to an element and its used  by JavaScript.</p>


<p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page . Once an element has been targeted , a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>

<p>There is a wide range of selectors available . Two of the most commonly used are Class and ID . Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
